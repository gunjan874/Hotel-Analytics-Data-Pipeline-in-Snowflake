# Hotel-Analytics-Data-Pipeline-in-Snowflake
Hotel Analytics Dashboard project that cleans and standardizes raw booking data to deliver clear business insights. It provides monthly revenue and booking trends, city-wise performance, booking type and status analysis, and key KPIs through interactive visualizations to support fast, data-driven decision making.

The achitecture diagram of the workflow is given below:

This SQL workflow implements a Bronze–Silver–Gold data pipeline in Snowflake. Raw CSV hotel booking data is staged and loaded into a bronze table, then cleaned and standardized in the silver layer with proper data types, validations, and transformations. Finally, gold tables are created for analytics-ready KPIs, daily bookings, revenue trends, and city-wise performance.

The Snowflake database HOTEL_DB is organized using a layered architecture. It includes a CSV file format and an internal stage for ingesting raw booking data. Tables are structured into Bronze (raw data), Silver (cleaned and standardized data), and Gold (aggregated and analytics-ready datasets) to support reporting, KPIs, and dashboarding efficiently.

Dashboard Visuals using Snowsight:
These visuals are created directly in Snowflake Snowsight using SQL queries on the Gold-layer tables. KPI tiles (Total Bookings, Total Revenue, Average Booking Value) are built using aggregate SQL functions like COUNT, SUM, and AVG. Bar charts for Top Cities, Bookings by Status, and Room Type are generated by grouping data with GROUP BY. Line charts for Monthly Revenue and Monthly Bookings use date-based aggregations. Snowsight automatically converts SQL result sets into interactive visuals, enabling quick, no-code dashboard creation.

The queries are also provided with in the files folder.
